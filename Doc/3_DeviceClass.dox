/*! @page page_3_deviceclass 3 - DeviceClass

The Device class bundles all class objects (like ScreenManagerClass or UserInputHandlerClass), all channels and other device related settings together. 
It is also responsible for loading and saving all settings from/to the EEPROM. 
A global clock is also generated here used for PID regulators, KeyPad handling and some other components.
